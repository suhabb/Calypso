/*
     The other benefit to adding the @FunctionalInterface annotation is that it generates a statement in the Javadocs as follows:
     Functional Interface:
     This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.
     Functional interfaces can have default and static methods as well.
     Both default and static methods have implementations, so they donâ€™t count against
     the single abstract method requirement.
